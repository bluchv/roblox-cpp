# Roblox-cpp

This project focuses on making a transpiler for C++ -> Luau (roblox).
This is more than likely never going to be "finished" or get very far. This is just an experiment of mine, on my journey
of learning C++. I've noticed rust is probably better lol, but there's already multiple roblox-rs projects, I doubt I
will continue learning C++ for anything practical, and just learn rust later if I need it. But I thought this would
still be a fun project to do and learn from.
